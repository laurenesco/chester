[IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT]  
  
A chess game created using QtCreator written in C++, with a machine learned engine written in C.  
  
Current classes:  
&ensp;&ensp;ChessBoard    - Manages the scene and view of the board  
&ensp;&ensp;ChessSquare   - Manages the squares on the board, manages event handling for the squares  
&ensp;&ensp;MainWindow    - Manages the main window of the application      
&ensp;&ensp;Sprite        - The current class for the chess piece icons. This will likely be replaced with individual classes for each piece type.
