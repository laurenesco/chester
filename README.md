[IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT]

A chess game created using QtCreator written in C++, with a machine learned engine written in C.

Current classes:
  ChessBoard    - Manages the scene and view of the board
  ChessSquare   - Manages the squares on the board, manages event handling for the squares
  MainWindow    - Manages the main window of the application    
  Sprite        - The current class for the chess piece icons. This will likely be replaced with individual classes for each piece type.
